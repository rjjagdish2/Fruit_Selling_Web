<b> FreshFruitHub </b>
This is my inaugural venture into creating a fruit selling website, so there might be some teething issues or methods that need refinement.

Services:

Cash on Delivery (COD) option available for convenient payment
Wide variety of fresh fruits available for purchase

For the front-end design and interactivity, I've employed HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and a touch of JavaScript for enhancing user experience.

For the backend infrastructure, I've utilized PHP scripting language for dynamic functionality, and the database is managed through phpMyAdmin using MySQL for storing product details, orders, and customer information.

I've ensured a seamless experience for customers who prefer the convenience of cash on delivery for their orders.

Thank you.
